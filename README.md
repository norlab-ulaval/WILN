# WILN - Weather-Invariant Lidar-based Navigation
WILN is a teach-and-repeat framework relying on lidar-based navigation to perform autonomous route repeating. This is the framework that was used in the ["Kilometer-scale autonomous navigation in subarctic forests: challenges and lessons learned"](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/publications/field-report-ltr/) field report. An overview of the system demonstration is presented in the following video :
